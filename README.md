# MEDICAL-DIAGNOSIS-OF-HUMAN-CARDIAC-ARREST-using-ML-models
Cardiac arrest stands as the foremost cause of mortality for both genders, presenting a pivotal challenge within the medical domain. Machine Learning plays a vital role in forecasting cardiac arrest, yielding notably accurate predictions.

Prominent classification methodologies utilized in this process include Support. Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and gradient boosting classifier. Particularly, Logistic Regression analysis has been conducted.

The prediction task was accomplished through a comprehensive array of ML models, complemented by rigorous data cleaning, data modeling, and visualization(EDA).
